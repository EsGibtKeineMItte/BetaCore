# How to setup BetaCore?

*MySQL*

If you want to use MySQL - you can do this but BetaCore althouth works without it.

You will need a MySQL Database, that you will have to setup a MySQL Database an a table called
PLAYER_INFO, which the columns UUID [varchar],Rank[String], Money[int], Rank [varchar].

You can see how to setup this MySQL Database in the wiki.

*Restart Script*

To Restart the Proxy automatically you will need a start.sh in your proxy folder.
Otherwise the server won't be able to restart automatically. 
You can download a restart script or see how to setup a restart scrips in the wiki.
